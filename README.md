### 🎯 What I Do

I design and build **intelligent systems** that perceive, learn, and act — bridging the gap between raw sensor data and meaningful automation.  
My work spans from smart vision-based interfaces to IoT-embedded AI prototypes, always with a focus on real-world impact.

- Currently diving into **Transformers, Self-Supervised Learning, and Real-Time Edge AI**  
- Passionate about **gesture/face tracking**, **signal-based detection**, and **HCI for assistive tech**  
- Strong foundation in Python, OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and hardware prototyping  
- If you mention **“AI + embedded systems”**, I’ll likely light up ☕
